# LoRd Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently in the implementation phase with the following active areas:
- Convex backend function development for deck and card management
- React frontend component development for user interface
- Authentication system integration
- AI functionality implementation
- Data schema design and optimization

## Recent Changes
- Basic project structure established with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Convex
- Authentication configuration implemented
- Initial deck management components created (DeckBuilder, DeckList, DeckView)
- Card data management functions in place
- AI integration started with basic functionality

## Next Steps
1. Complete user authentication flow implementation
2. Finalize deck creation and management workflows
3. Implement card data fetching and display
4. Enhance AI features for deck analysis and suggestions
5. Improve UI/UX with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
6. Add comprehensive error handling and validation
7. Implement proper state management patterns
8. Add testing for critical functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using Convex for real-time backend functionality
- Leveraging Convex Auth for authentication
- Implementing AI features through Convex actions
- Following modern React patterns with TypeScript
- Using Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Structuring code with clear separation of concerns

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Function-based Convex implementation (not class-based)
- TypeScript strict typing throughout
- Component-based React architecture
- RESTful API design principles where applicable
- Clean, maintainable code organization
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Current Learnings and Insights
- Convex provides excellent real-time capabilities for collaborative features
- The authentication flow requires careful consideration of user experience
- AI integration benefits from proper context management
- Component reusability is important for maintainable UI
- Data schema design impacts performance and scalability

## Challenges and Risks
- Ensuring proper data consistency across real-time updates
- Managing authentication state across the application
- Optimizing AI functionality for performance
- Balancing feature completeness with development speed
- Maintaining code quality as the project grows
